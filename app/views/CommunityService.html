    <li>Choose a service activity and wait for the organization to contact you to schedule the activity.</li>
    <li>Appear in court. Inform the judge of your interest in community service in lieu of payment and come to an agreement regarding the activity, number of hours and timeframe.</li>
    <li>Do the community service and get a verification from your mentor, including the number of hours served.</li>
    <li>Finally, once completed, provide the verification from your mentor to the court clerk, which can be done at any time. The clerk will present the verification to the judge who will determine if the service is satisfactory. If it is, your case will be cleared.
